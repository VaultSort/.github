## ℹ️ About VaultSort for Mac

VaultSort was built with a simple but powerful goal: to make **file management and data security seamless** for everyday Mac users as well as professionals who handle sensitive documents. Over time, computers collect scattered files — downloads, documents, photos, work projects — often left unorganized and vulnerable. VaultSort solves this by combining **smart sorting, encryption, and secure deletion** into one unified workflow.  

Its intelligent sorting engine automatically categorizes files by type, size, and date, moving them into structured vaults or folders that are easy to navigate. No more messy desktops or bloated Downloads folders — everything is sorted into place instantly.  

For privacy-conscious users, VaultSort goes further by offering **AES-level encryption** to protect confidential files. Whether it’s financial records, legal documents, or personal photos, VaultSort ensures that only authorized users can access protected vaults.  

Another key feature is **secure erasure**. Standard file deletion on macOS doesn’t completely erase data; it can often be recovered with specialized tools. VaultSort prevents this by overwriting deleted data, ensuring files are permanently and irreversibly erased. This makes it particularly valuable for professionals who must comply with **data protection regulations** like GDPR or HIPAA.  

The application is also built for performance. Optimized for Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, VaultSort runs lightweight background tasks that organize and secure files without slowing down your system. Advanced users can customize rules for file sorting, while everyday users benefit from automated presets.  

VaultSort is not just a utility — it is a **digital safety net**, combining smart organization with enterprise-grade security. Whether you’re a student keeping classwork tidy, a lawyer securing case files, or a creative professional managing projects, VaultSort adapts to your workflow and ensures your data remains both organized and safe.
